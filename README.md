# BMI Calculator (Python)

A simple Python program that calculates BMI (Body Mass Index) using user-provided weight in pounds and height in inches.  
The script converts the inputs into metric units and determines whether the user is underweight, normal, overweight, or obese.

## How It Works

1. User enters:
   - Weight in pounds
   - Height in inches
2. The program converts:
   - Pounds → kilograms  
   - Inches → meters
3. BMI is calculated using the formula: 
   - BMI = weight_kg / (height_m^2)
4. The result is classified into:
- Underweight  
- Normal  
- Overweight  
- Obese
